# Boba Rush

This is an interactive multiplayer game made in Godot with multiplayer logic hosted via Firebase. The player's aim is to create a drink with both speed and accuracy in order to provide for the 'customer'. Players are scored out of 100 points, 50 points which are dedicated to accuracy and 50 points which are dedicated to speed. As each second passes by, players lose a point in speed. Accuracy points are deducted based on how far the user's estimate for values is from the actual value (i.e. estimated rgb versus actual color).
